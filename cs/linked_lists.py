# Linked lists: each element is a node. Each node has a value and a pointer pointing to the next value.
# You make a class, a class is ... WHAT?
# This is example how you would create a class of objects in Python

# Linked lists are not a native structure in Python (can't use 'built-in' Python), so we have to MAKE IT FROM SCRATCH

# You may have done FUNCTIONS, but maybe not OBJECTS


# Linked List: imagine a chain link fence? Linked list is a list of things all connected to one another. W/ an array I have to allocate all of this space
# in memory all the way. Linked list can grow over time, nodes don't have to be stored all in the same place in memory!
# Array is a contiguous block of memory. Memory-inefficient to make an array. Linked List lets you build it up one piece at a time.
# It's like a junk drawer where you can just throw stuff where you have space.
# 'Piecemeal' array
